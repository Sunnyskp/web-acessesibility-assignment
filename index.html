                    <h2>Conan Visits Taco Bell</h2>
                      <b>Conan:</b> We have a guy on our staff who is the head of our IT department his name is Chris Hays. This is a photo of him. Yea, a little confident. He is a great guy.<br> 
                      <b>-</b> Very mister clean.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>I know Exactly. He is a great guy. He is a computer genius. Here is the thing, Whenever I walk by Chris’s desk, it’s not that far from my office, whenever I walk by his desk, he is almost always eating taco-bell. And I am not making that up. He is obsessed with their food.<br> 
                      <b>-</b>yes.<br>
                      <b>Conan:</b> Like its like a religion with him.<br>
                      <b>-</b>yes.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  Okay. And its going to a point where we are making jokes about it at the office. Well that got me wondering, if Chris loves taco-bell so much is there something that I can do for him that wont cost me any money but give him great joy using the incredible power I have in show business. Okay. Well I thought about it and I came up with a scheme. Here is what I did.<br>
                      Ah I wanted to do a nice thing for you because I make peoples dreams come true. I am the TV host that -<br>
                      <b>Chris:</b> Oh, I know you and most likely that’s Ellen that does that.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  You think its more Ellen than me.<br>
                      <b>Chris:</b> Yes, Yes.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  Fair…Okay, Alright, Ellen does that. This is what I did. I have taken Chris here to taco-bell headquarters in Irvine California and we are going to give you the complete taco-bell experience. Get in here. You are harder than I thought. So, we are going to go in right now to the sleepy little hamlet that is the taco-bell. There it is. Right there. Tiny little Mexican village.<br>
                      <b>Chris:</b> Let’s do it.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  This is Katie Garner. Hai Katie.<br>
                      <b>Katie:</b> Hai.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  And you are marketing manager –<br>
                      <b>Katie:</b> I am.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  -here at taco-bell.<br>
                      <b>Katie:</b> Yes.<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  You are going to give Chris the full taco-bell experience today?<br>
                      <b>Katie:</b> Yeah, we have quite a few superfans, so we kind of an experience that we like to save for all of you special, special people-<br>
                     <b>Conan:</b>  When you say superfan, define superfans, how many times a week someone have to eat taco-bell to consider as a superfan.<br>
                     <b>Katie:</b>  I would say atleast twice a week....
