00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Well today I am looking at what I believe is the sweet spot in the Honda Civic line if

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,800
you are an enthusiast driver. This is the Honda civic SI.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,260
It is the 4-door sedan. The SI is also available in the 2-door coupe. You cannot get it in the hatchback.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,460
You get a sport model or the sport touring but it doesn’t have the same engine as this and of course in the hatch

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,260
you  can get the type R which adds another 100+ horse power but that is 40,000$ car and

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,600
it doesn’t have the looks that’s would ever appeal to me in fact I don’t think that the hatchbacks are great looking

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,560
Honda civic. I think that the coupe and the sedan are much better looking in my opinion.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,500
A lot of it comes down to how busy the new civic is with the hatchback you get a blunt rear end.

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,800
You get all the black cladding along the bottom of the bumper looks like a cheese grater.

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:53,460
You get it with this car too but it seems to integrate a little bit better with the type R there is wings

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,760
there is fins there is all of this cladding on it that just is not going to appeal to a certain segment of the market

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,480
for me personally I would rather have a much more subdued looking car like a Volkswagen golf R

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,180
or a WRX something like that. So this is really why I think this is the sweet spot so with the SI in the sedan you get

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,780
18 inch wheels, you get a spoiler around the back of the car, you get a center exhaust tip which really

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,280
looks unique and sporty and it has a nice look to it. It definitely looks good with this black and

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,520
blue contrasting colors and yes you still get those cheese grater effects on the front lower valance

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,260
and the rear of the bumpers which looked like a after thought but they are done to anchor the car and

18
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,540
make it look like it’s part of the road. I am not going to talk too much about the civic because it's

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,660
been out for couple of years. It won the car of the year, North American car of the year.

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,500
It’s a wonderful product touch on what’s different on the inside but the biggest

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,480
part of the story is what it's like to live with every single day.

22
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,500
Notice as I mentioned I am not going to talk too much about the car generally because

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,240
it’s been out for couple of years and won all kinds of awards. One thing about civic it's big.

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,400
This is bigger than the original accord was and when the Si is equipped, you get the nicely bolstered

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,000
SI seats in cloth which is great for gripping you get the aluminum pedals underneath them you get a nice feeling

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,760
manual shifter and an excellent cockpit seating position in Honda's has always been first rate especially

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,660
in this civic line and this one is no different. One thing I am not crazy about with the manual transmission,

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,220
I just thought of it when I started up you have an electronic parking brake switch here which I am not

29
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:37,140
loving with any manual transmission car. Okay. So two generations ago they used to have a 2 liter

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:46,420
very highly strung engine in the SI. It is a really wind it out. I called it a cat on caffeine. Yeah it was like

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,380
ready to pounce at any time and I never really liked that car because it  had no bottom and torque and

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,360
it had to ring out the engine and get it really going in a big way to get the most out of it.

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,160
So, what did civic do was it Honda do with the civic SI
